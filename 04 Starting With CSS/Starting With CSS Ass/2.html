        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a stylesheet language used to control the presentation and layout of web documents written in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). CSS allows web developers to apply styles and formatting to HTML elements, such as fonts, colors, margins, padding, positioning, and more.

        The purpose of CSS is to separate the content of a web page (HTML) from its presentation (styles). By using CSS, you can create a consistent and visually appealing design for your website, making it easier to maintain and update the appearance across multiple web pages.

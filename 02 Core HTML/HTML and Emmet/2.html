    <h1>Comments</h1>
    <p>
      HTML comments are used to insert notes or explanations within the HTML
      code that are ignored by web browsers. They serve as a way for developers
      to add descriptive information, reminders, or temporarily disable sections
      of code. They can span multiple lines and are primarily used for
      documentation purposes or to hide code without deleting it. Comments are
      useful for clarifying the purpose of specific code segments, aiding
      collaboration between developers, and making future modifications easier.
      They have no impact on the visual display or functionality of the webpage
      and are purely for human consumption.

        Web development refers to the process of creating and maintaining
        websites and web applications. It involves various tasks such as coding,
        designing, and organizing content to be displayed on the internet. Web
        developers utilize programming languages, frameworks, and tools to build
        interactive and functional websites that cater to users' needs. They
        handle both the front-end (user interface) and back-end (server-side)
        development aspects, ensuring seamless functionality, responsiveness,
        and compatibility across different devices and browsers. Web development
        encompasses tasks like HTML markup, CSS styling, JavaScript programming,
        database management, and server configuration. It is a dynamic field
        that continues to evolve with emerging technologies.

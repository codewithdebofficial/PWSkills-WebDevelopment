        Web design refers to the process of creating visually appealing and
        user-friendly interfaces for websites. It involves designing the layout,
        typography, colors, and graphics that enhance the overall user
        experience. Web designers employ various tools, such as graphic design
        software and prototyping tools, to create mockups and wireframes that
        showcase the website's structure and navigation. They consider
        usability, accessibility, and responsive design principles to ensure the
        website functions effectively across different devices and screen sizes.
        Web designers collaborate with web developers to transform their design
        concepts into functional websites. They strive to create engaging and
        intuitive interfaces that convey the brand's identity and effectively
        communicate with the target audience.
